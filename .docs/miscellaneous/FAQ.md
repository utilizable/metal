#### Question: Why don't we need to use VirtualGL?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<br>
<!--- ANSWER --->   
Think of containers like laptops. On laptops, we often deal with NVIDIA Prime and Bumblebee to manage GPU usage. However, in containers, the primary GPU is usually LLVMPipe, instead of the Intel integrated GPU. To ensure we use the NVIDIA GPU, we can set the following environment variables:
<br><br>
   
   - `__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1`
   - `__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=NVIDIA`
   
   These settings force graphic applications to utilize the NVIDIA GPU. For more details, you can refer to the official NVIDIA documentation [here](https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/435.17/README/primerenderoffload.html).

#### Question: Why can't I fully utilize WSL?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<br>
<!--- ANSWER --->      
Unfortunately, Microsoft started implementing [D3D12](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-24.1-Zink-D3D12-Default) in Mesa around year or two ago? - which limits our ability to use all Vulkan functions, resulting in significantly poor performance.

#### Question: Are there other solutions to share GPU?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<br>
<!--- ANSWER --->   
   
- **Intel**: Offers various solutions for virtual GPU sharing, particularly through their integrated graphics.
- **AMD**: Provides solutions like MxGPU, which allows multiple virtual machines to share a single GPU.
- **Dual-Coder Crack for RTX Series 20***: Enables the use of NVIDIA's vGPU technology on consumer-grade RTX 20 series cards.
- **Older NVIDIA GPUs**: Models like the K2 support vGPU technology, which can be leveraged for virtualization and resource sharing.
